CS50 Web Project 0
HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Sass.

For project 0 I chose to re-do the HTML and CSS on SQuASH, my final
project from CS50.

SQuASH, if you recall, is a Simple Quantative Analyzer of Submission History, a tool to
graph submissions to reddit.

I wasn't really looking to change the look or functionality the site, but so much
of the original HTML came about through my own trial and error that it was a bit
all over the place, syntatically speaking. There was also no real mobile responsiveness.

The site is comprised of four pages, an index (with an image and an input form with some javascript),
a results page which displays the completed graph, a documentation page and an error page. There was
also a simple nav-bar. For the purposes of this project i disabled the actual functionality
of the site as well as any javascript which will have to be re-implemented later on.

A good example of the kind of improvements i was looking to make is buttons. As it stood
all the buttons on the site were these pre-made bootstrap warning buttons. Back when i
was first working on the site it was super easy to implement these buttons and i think they
fit well with the look of the site. There wasn't anything exactly wrong with them, but
they wern't great from a design point of view beacuse i couldn't easily change what they
look like, if i ever wanted to. The new and improved buttons don't really look much diffrent
from the old premade ones, but they are fully customisable so in that sense are a definate step up.

I'll shortly be making a video which will cover the mobile responsiveness and other improvements
i've made to the site as part of project 0.
